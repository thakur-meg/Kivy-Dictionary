This is a simple mobile application based on pythong made using the tkinter library and the kivy library. The application searches for the word through the database and displays the meaning(s) of the word on the screen. In the instances where the word is not found, it runs a close match of the word. If found with 0.8 accuracy, the close match is suggested as an alternative. If not, the app displays the message that the word is not found.
